# MedLinkAI+

MedLinkAI+ is a smart pre-diagnostic system powered by Generative AI (LLM-based), aimed at enhancing communication between patients and healthcare providers. By offering personalized symptom interpretation and recommending medical services, it helps streamline diagnostic processes while overcoming language and cultural barriers. 

The system is designed to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce the workload for healthcare professionals, and ultimately reduce healthcare costs.

## Features

### 1. Intelligent Symptom Interpretation
- Recognizes colloquial patient complaints and converts them into medical insights for healthcare providers.
- Supports multiple languages (e.g., Cantonese, Mandarin, and English) to overcome communication barriers.

### 2. Automated Pre-diagnostic Report Generation
- Produces real-time pre-diagnostic reports based on patient input, minimizing the time clinicians spend on reviewing charts.
- Ensures that no patient data is stored on servers via front-end JSON, adhering to strict privacy protocols.

### 3. Extensive Medical Coverage
- Covers over 100 medical specialties, 800+ symptoms, and provides diagnostic support for more than 2,000 diseases.
- Compatible with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for flexible integration and scalability.

### 4. Seamless EHR Integration
- Transforms dialogue into clinical notes and automatically integrates them into Electronic Health Records (EHR) for streamlined workflows.

### 5. Model Precision and Tuning
- Regularly optimized for prompt precision, role assignment, and workflow improvements to ensure accurate results for diverse medical conditions.
